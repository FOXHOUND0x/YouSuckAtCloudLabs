# Programmatically Manage Users and Groups within Microsoft Entra ID.



In this lab you are going to deploy 2 types of users within Microsoft Entra ID using Pulumi. One user will be a global administrator and another will be a normal "member". You will create these users with a method called `Bulk Add Users`  with a CSV file ingestion. Post initial deployment, you will need to update the user properties to grant access of the member to a group that has access to maintain resources inside of The0xSec Resource Group.
