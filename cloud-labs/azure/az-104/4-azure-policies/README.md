## How to deploy Azure Policies using Pulumi
In this lab, deploy the Azure Policy using Pulumi defined in `main.go` file. Login to the Azure portal and verify the deployment of the policy. Notice how the policy is tied to the resource group called `the0xResourceGroup`.

## Goal
The goal is to see how the azure policy is tied to the Resource Group and that various resources objects are grouped together in a logical manner and stored within a single subscription. In the diagram provided you can see we have a resource-group which consists of a VM and a Storage Account. These two resources are paired together.

## Cleanup
After you have verified the deployment, remove the resources by running `pulumi destroy` and then `pulumi stack rm dev` to remove the stack.
